# Data Protection & Privacy course
## Implementation of Incognito: Efficient Full-Domain K-Anonimity  

Project for the course of Data Protection and Privacy - A. Y. 2018/19
In the project we will implement the Incognito algorithm proposed by LeFevre K., DeWitt D.J., Ramakrishnan R. - University of Wisconsin - Madison .

We will use the Adult dataset available on UCI Machine Learning Repository [ https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult ] in order to compare our results with the ones in the paper.

### Prerequisites

To run the Python version of the code, you will need Python 3.6. 

For Linux/Mac machines, you will probably already have Python, just check that your current version is the last available, running 
```
python --version
```
in your terminal, update in case you need it.

For Windows machines, you will need to install Python from this website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

To run the Jupyter version of the code, you will need to install Anaconda so that you will have both Python and Jupyter on your machine.

For both Linux/Windows/Mac you can find Anaconda at this link: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

### Running on Jupyter

Once you have started Jupyter and it has opened in your browser, just navigate to the right directory where you have the files, and open the code.

To run the code, just click (on top-right of your window) on Kernel -> Restart and Run All.

### Running on Python

Open your terminal and run

```
python DPP_Project.py
```
